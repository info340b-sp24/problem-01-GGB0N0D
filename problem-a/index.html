        <!--have a description of Spike-->
        Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite Japanese anime, and I really admire
        its protagonist--<cite><a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Spike_Spiegel">Spike Spiegel</a></cite>.
        He is a bounty hunter on a spaceship called Bebop and travels through space with his crew.

        <ul>Reasons why I admire Spike
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">He is mysterious</span>. The beginning of the Cowboy Bebop didn't introduce his background story. It
            is being revealed through multiple episodes, and that makes me interested in the story behind him.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">He is both physically and mentally strong.</span> He knows how to shoot and fight, that makes most situations
            safe when I saw him appear. And also he is always calm and chill, his steady emotion makes him reliable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">He values his friendship.</span> Although he sometimes will have arguments with his crew, he never really gave
            up on them. Oppositely, he remembers and cares every friends he met in his heart.
          </li>
        </ul>
